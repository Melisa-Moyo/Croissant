            <strong>What is a Croissant? </strong>
            <br />
            A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that
            contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture.
            Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked
            goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant
            usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar.croissant is
            more than a mere pastry; it's a masterpiece that bridges the gap
            between baking and artistry.

            <strong>Origin</strong>
            <br />
            The croissant's origin dates back to Vienna in 1683. Legend has it
            that it was created to commemorate the city's defense against
            Turkish troops. The Viennese bakers, alerted by the attack, crafted
            a crescent-shaped pastry symbolizing the Ottoman emblem. Later
            introduced to France, Marie-Antoinette popularized the croissant in
            the late 1700s, adding to its global fame. <br />

            <strong>Types of Croissant</strong>
            <br />
            Croissants come in various delightful variations that cater to
            different tastes and preferences. The classic Plain Croissant stands
            as a testament to simplicity and indulgence, boasting layers of
            tender dough with a delicate balance of buttery richness. For those
            seeking a touch of sweetness, the Almond Croissant emerges as a
            popular choice, enveloping almond paste within its layers and
            adorned with a sprinkle of sliced almonds, offering a delightful
            nutty contrast. A delectable twist on tradition can be found in the
            Chocolate Croissant, where ribbons of chocolate intermingle with
            each fold of the dough, creating a luscious melange of flavors. For
            savory enthusiasts, the Ham and Cheese Croissant combines the
            flakiness of croissant dough with the salty goodness of ham and the
            gooey allure of melted cheese, resulting in a satisfying and savory
            experience.
